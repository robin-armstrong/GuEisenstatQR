# GuEisenstatQR

This package provides `srrqr`, a Julia implementation of the strong rank-revealing QR factorization of Gu and Eisenstat. See Ming Gu and Stanley Eisenstat, *Efficient Algorithms for Computing a Strong Rank-Revealing QR Factorization*, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 17 (1996). The package can be installed by running the following commands in Julia:
```
import Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/robin-armstrong/GuEisenstatQR.git")
```

After installation, running `using GuEisenstatQR` will bring `srrqr` into the namespace. Running `?srrqr` in a Julia REPL will show detailed documentation for the function.
